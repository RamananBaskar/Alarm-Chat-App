# Alarm-Chat-App
This is an app I created using Android Studio for controlling an Alarm setup made using Arduino Nano and a SIM-800L GSM module. It uses Telephony SMS services to communicate to the hardware to turn on and off the alarm as well as to alert the user. NOTE: This is just the android app code and does not contain the arduino code
